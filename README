Constantia is a general-purpose utilities library for Common Lisp.

Its purpose is to serve as a single place for all the sufficiently
general, useful, and small utilities I use in my everyday projects.

It is not expressly intended for public consumption, but you are
welcome to use it, should you choose to - it's released under the MIT
license.  Relevant criticism will be appreciated as well.

Yes, the naming was inspired by the famous Alexandria library.
